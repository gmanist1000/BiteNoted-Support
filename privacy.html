        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted is a personal food journal. Your content is stored on your device and can be synced to your private iCloud database when you're signed in to iCloud. We do not run our own servers for your journal content, we do not sell your data, and we do not use third-party analytics or crash reporting SDKs.</p>

        <h2>Data you create</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Journal entries you write, including titles, notes, ratings, tags, and dates</li>
          <li>Photos you take or select for entries</li>
          <li>Places you select or search for, including coordinates, names, addresses, phone numbers, and URLs</li>
          <li>Custom fields, templates, saved searches, and filters you configure</li>
          <li>Profile stats and insights derived from your entries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Device permissions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Camera: to take entry photos</li>
          <li>Photo Library: to attach photos you select</li>
          <li>Location (when in use): to show your location on the map and pin entries</li>
          <li>Face ID or Touch ID: to unlock Privacy Lock if you enable it</li>
          <li>Tracking (optional): to request permission for personalized ads in the free plan (IDFA)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We use your data to save and organize your journal, show entries on the map, power widgets, and create exports and backups. Recent place searches and app settings are stored locally to make the app feel faster and more personal. Widgets use a shared on-device app group container to store summaries (recent entry, stats summary, on-this-day entries, and quick add templates); you can hide widget content with Privacy Lock.</p>

        <h2>Advertising and tracking</h2>
        <p>The free plan shows ads provided by Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). If you allow tracking, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may use the device's advertising identifier (IDFA) to personalize ads and measure ad performance. If you decline tracking, ads are non-personalized. AdMob may still collect device information (such as IP address, device identifiers, and coarse location) for ad delivery and fraud prevention as described in Google's policies. Apple SKAdNetwork is used for ad attribution. Purchasing No Ads or Pro disables ads and the tracking prompt.</p>

        <h2>Sharing and third-party services</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted uses Apple and Google services to provide core features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apple iCloud/CloudKit: sync and store your journal in your private iCloud database</li>
          <li>Apple MapKit and location services: map display, place search, and reverse geocoding</li>
          <li>Apple StoreKit: in-app purchases and restore purchases</li>
          <li>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob): ads in the free plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These providers may collect device and usage data as described in their own privacy policies. We do not share your journal content with advertisers. If you choose to share an entry, photo, or stats snapshot, the content is shared through the iOS share sheet and sent only to the destination you choose.</p>

        <h2>Storage and security</h2>
        <p>Your journal is stored locally on your device and synced via your private iCloud database when you're signed in to iCloud. Backups are created as local zip files that you export and store wherever you choose. iOS device protections apply to on-device data. Privacy Lock uses system authentication and does not access or store your Face ID/Touch ID data.</p>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted registers for background remote notifications to keep iCloud sync up to date. These are sent by Apple for CloudKit sync and are not used to send marketing messages.</p>

        <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>Your journal data is stored on your device. If iCloud Sync is enabled, it's stored in your private iCloud database. You can delete individual entries or delete all entries in Settings to remove your data; deletions sync to iCloud. Exported backups remain wherever you save them until you delete them.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage your iCloud sign-in and iCloud sync in iOS Settings</li>
          <li>Deny location or camera access in iOS Settings</li>
          <li>Deny tracking permission to receive non-personalized ads</li>
          <li>Purchase No Ads or Pro to remove ads</li>
          <li>Delete entries or delete all entries to remove your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data we do not collect</h2>
        <p>We do not require accounts, and we do not collect your name, email address, phone number, contacts, or payment information. Payments are handled by Apple through the App Store.</p>

        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the date above and ship the update in the app.</p>
