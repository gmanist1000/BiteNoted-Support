        <p>BiteNoted is a personal food journal for iOS that helps you remember meals by place, photos, and notes. This policy explains what data the app handles and how you can control it.</p>

        <h2>Data you store in the app</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted stores the information you enter or capture, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Entries (title, item type, visit date, rating, notes, tags, favorites).</li>
          <li>Photos you attach to entries (multi-photo supported).</li>
          <li>Location and place metadata (MapKit points of interest, address, phone, URL).</li>
          <li>Location context such as city, state, and country.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Location usage</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted requests location access when in use to help you attach a place to an entry. Location is only used while the app is active and is stored with entries you save.</p>

        <h2>Camera and photos</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted can access the camera so you can take photos for entries. Photos are stored locally in the app and can be synced via iCloud when enabled.</p>

        <h2>iCloud sync</h2>
        <p>iCloud sync is included for all plans. Your data is stored in your private iCloud/CloudKit database and photos are stored as iCloud assets. Apple manages this storage under your Apple ID.</p>

        <h2>Export and import</h2>
        <p>You can export your data as a JSON file and a ZIP archive containing <code>entries.json</code> and your photos. Imports use the same formats to restore your data.</p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted relies on Apple services like iCloud/CloudKit, MapKit, and StoreKit for purchases. The free plan can show ads served by Google Mobile Ads. These providers may process limited device or usage data as part of their services.</p>

        <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>You control your data in BiteNoted. You can delete entries and photos within the app. Uninstalling the app removes local data. You can delete the synced data from your iCloud settings or by disabling sync and removing the data from your account.</p>

        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>BiteNoted is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the effective date above.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions, email <a href="mailto:support@bitenoted.app">support@bitenoted.app</a>.</p>
